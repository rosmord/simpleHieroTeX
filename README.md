# SimpleHieroTeX

A very very **alpha** version of an alternative to HieroTeX, without the need for external software.
This should work simply with `xelatex` (it won't work with pdflatex, for instance).

**BEWARE : the style is very likely to change somehow. It's currently a cheap hack around HieroTeX.**

It uses a Unicode hieroglyphic font. You need to get one. Currently, I only support http://files.qenherkhopeshef.org/jsesh/JSeshFont.ttf. But other fonts will be easy to use too.

1. Install the truetype font
2. run the example :

    xelatex simpleExample.tex

Documentation will be written a bit later.
